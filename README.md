# DMCF
Matlab source code of tracking algorithm, paper submitted to Acta Electronica Sinica.

./run_DMCF.m is the baisc function to test our algorithm on benchmarks OTB2015[1], TinyTLP[2] and UAV20L[3]

We successfully tested our algorithm in the following two platforms:

-Window 10, matlab2017a, VS2015
